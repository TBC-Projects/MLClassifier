# Actuation Documentation — November 13, 2025

## Overview
During this meeting, we continued gathering resources and component information needed for the actuation subsystem. The focus was on understanding hardware requirements and evaluating alternatives.

## Key Activities
- Downloaded and reviewed the schematic for the TI LaunchPad to better understand available interfaces and power constraints.
- Researched potential replacements for the LED and speaker components to determine which options best suit our design needs.

## Next Steps
- Evaluate the newly researched LED and speaker options.
- Identify any compatibility considerations with the LaunchPad.
- Prepare a shortlist of components for testing in the next session.
